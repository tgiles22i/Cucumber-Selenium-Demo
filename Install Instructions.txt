Installing and Configuring Rubymine and Ruby

All code written in these demonstrations was developed using Rubymine and Ruby.

To install Ruby, visit RubyInstaller.com and visit their archives to install version 1.9.3 of Ruby (DO NOT INSTALL x64 AS NEDDED GEMS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERSIONS ABOVE 1.9.3 OR x64). 
http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives

To use Rubymine's debugger you will need to install the Ruby Development kit located on the right side of the archive page (DevKit-tdm-32-4.5.2-20111229-1559-sfx.exe)

After downloading the DevKit, unpack the zip file into the file path of Ruby 1.9.3 (example: C:\Ruby193\bin is where I put mine)

In the command line, change directory to your ruby installation and run ruby dk.rb init to create config yml file

Lastly run ruby dk.rb install to connect the dev kit to 1.9.3

Needed Gems:
Nokogiri
Open-Uri
Cucumber

Builder

To install the above gems open command line and run gem install <gem name> (ex gem install Nokogiri)
